 * lock-protected ring buffer; a dispatch source is signaled. The hot path
 * is non-blocking and bounded (~200ns) — buffer overflow drops the oldest
 * event.
 *
 * Consumers register via fakefs_install_change_consumer(). The handler is
 * invoked on the consumer's serial dispatch queue with a batch of events;
 * dispatch_source coalesces multiple producer signals into one wakeup.
